background:
the spreader detector program:
The Detector Spreader software is a sophisticated and multi-system software designed to identify
potential contagion chains, evaluate the The chance that a person will infect the corona and update
the potential infected with record speed and efficiency. In this exercise you will exercise part of
this system.

The software works as follows:

1) It receives an identity card from a person identified as carrying a corona and videos in
which he is identified (documenting some period of his life) may be Several minutes, several hours
and even days.

2) Extract the information from the videos as follows: who did the bearer meet, who did the ones he
met meet and so on until you identify all The people who appeared in the videos and know who met
whom and at what stage.

3) Transfers the information it extracted to a data structure (details below),

4) Assess the chance of each of the candidates to be infected from the identified carrier.

5) Updates the potential infects according to this information and the level of severity.

The program that i write in this program will implement sections 5-3 in the software. That is, the
program receive information extracted from a person's videos Identified as corona carriers, analyze
it, process it and determine the order of updating the  potential contagious that they need to
enter isolation or Medical supervision or they are exempt from any obligation.


What your application does,
################################################################################################

the SpreaderDetectorBackend processes:
implementation of the main part of the Detector Spreader software. The realization will be done in
several steps:
1) Receiving the input and processing it.
2) Construction of the appropriate data structure.
3) Assessing a person's chances of infection.
4) Collection of results and sorting.
5) Return output that describes the list of people by level of severity and how each should be treated
